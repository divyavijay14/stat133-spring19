Description: Functions to create private functions such as checker functions
    and auxiliary functions that calculate the expected value and variance of a 
    binomial distributions; to calculate the number of successes that can occur within
    a given number of trials; visualize frequencies of successes among a given number
    of trials and probability. There are also functions to calculate dataframes that
    have both the probability distribution and cumulative probability functions.
